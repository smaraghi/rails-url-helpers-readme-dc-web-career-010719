Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,â€¦,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100. For example 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.

1...9 => 100





pos a = numbers with +
pos b = numbers with -
pos c = numbers together

def number_pos(order)


end
